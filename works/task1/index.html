            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It provides the basic structure of a website by using a series of elements, or "tags," which define and organize different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is easy to learn and use, making it the backbone of web development. By combining HTML with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, developers can create rich, interactive web experiences.
